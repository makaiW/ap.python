# 1. Describe what a computer program is and what does it do.

computer program is a detailed problem or sovling something with a computer. 

# 2. Describe what complexitity and abstraction are, then provide an example
# of complexity in the real world and how we apply abstraction to that thing (you example must be original and cannot be an example
# used in our lecture slides ie car, grocery store, etc.). 
 
  complexitity-is like to descride a characteristics of a code specfie code 
  x = complex{3,5}
 
  abstraction - a programmer that hides relvent data of the object. 
  
  abstract class Animal {
  public abstract void animalSound();
  public void sleep() {
    System.out.println("Zzz")

# 3. What is Syntax in Python and why is it important to write proper syntax?
a set of rules to define how the funcations written.Why is it important it is important to define how the python is written


# 4. What is a function, and why do we wrap our code inside of functions? 
it is a block of code to tell or perfrom a task.so we can give it a comman 

# 5. Name and describe the three (3) naming conventions for variables in python? Then provide three (3) name rules for Python
# variables. 
camal case-second word of a variable name and every word stars with a capital letter 
pascal case-every word icluding the first word,starts wityh a capital letter
snake case- every word is separated by an underscore 

# 6. What will be the output of the print functons when this code is ran, explain why
name = 'Bill'
student = name
name = 'Walter'
student= 'Richard'
print(name)
print(student)
it would output the name and the the student name whuch is bill 
# 7. Describe the difference between each of the following assignment operators:
# = assign
# == is equal to
# != is not equal to
 
# 8. What type of data can be stored in a python list?
a integer,strings,flaots,boolean
# 9. Create a function that will take in a word provided by a user and then output that word back to the user but in reverse.
 
  def"the sunshine give me{word}"
   word'joy'
     input{word}
     
# 10. Create three (3) seperate functions that will do addition, subtraction, and multiplication respectively
 
# each of these functions should take two (2) arguments. When the user passes these arguments into the function, they will be
# calculated together and return the output in your terminal. 

# 11. What is the difference between a function argument and a function parameter.
a agruement funcation is a agurment that pushing a agrugment  
a function parameter is a variable  define a funcation 
# 12. You have been hired by a software company and your first assignment is to develop a password authenticator program. 
# the goal of your program is to check a user's password and make sure it meets the company's password requirements. 
# the company has provided you with the following requirements for the passcode program:
# a. the passcode must NOT contain any numbers
# b. the passcode must NOT contain any capital letters
# c. the passcode can NOT be any longer than five (5) characters
# d. the passcode can NOT shorter the three (3) characters
# e. the user should be able to enter their password and if it meets the requirements, should print a message saying that 
# their password was created successfully, and if it was not, should send back a message with one of the following issues. 
newJob{company password}{'cat'}
print {comapcy pasword}
if{enter correct password"successfully"}
else {enter the wrong password"issue"}
# 13. When you run your code and see typeError in your terminal, what does that typically mean and how would you try to solve
# the issue? 
it means there is a msistake in your code and you can fix by going to see the red underline or it would say what line its on and fix your mistake 
# 14. When you run your code and see indentError in your terminal, what does that typically mean and how would you try to solve 
# the issue? 
a indenterror is a error when you have to mant indents so what you have to do is delete some of your indents 
# 15. Create a while loop that check a user's password. If they enter the password correct, they will get a message saying 
# that the password was entered successfully. If they enter the password incorrectly, it will tell the user to try again. 
# The user should only have three (3) attempts to get the password correct. If they enter the password incorrect on the fourth 
# attempt, a message should appear telling them that have been locked out and need to talk to the administrator. 
while i=4
password{chickenbutt1234}
if print {the was right enter"successfully"}
if print {the password was incorrect enter"incorrectly"}
while password>i
# 16. Which item is at index 5
giftShopping=['xbox','sneakers','necklace','clothing','laptop','gift card']
index 5 is a laptop
# 17. Create a for loop that will print ONLY the even numbers within the range of the variable provided below.
# HINT: You will need to use the range() function. 
upToNumber = 30
# 18. Create a function that uses a conditional statement that checks if a person qualifies for a raise on their salary. 
# The user should be able to enter their name, their salary (how much money they make in an entire year), and how long they have
# worked at the company. If the user has been working at the company longer than four (4) years, they will get a 15% raise. 
# Your program should be able to calculate what their salary is with the 15% increase. If the user qualifies, your program
# should return the a message congratulating the user by name, and telling them what their new salary is with the 15%
# increase (this must be the actual number). If they do not qualify inform the user that unfortunately they do not qualify. 
# 19. Create a function that checks which value is greater than the other. Your function should take two (2) integer parameters. 
# and should evaluate which number is larger. Your function should then print the largest number. 
# 20. Create a while loop function that will add gift items to a list. Your function should ask the user to enter an item name. 
# The item name should then be added to a list variable called gift_bag. Your gift bag should have a limit of six (6) items. 
# Once your gift bag hits its limit of six (6) items your program should print a message saying 
# that the gift bag is full and print the list of items in the gift bag.
