# 1. Provided below is some starter code. 
# Fix this code to create a loop that will iterate
# until it gets to the number 10.

# hint: remember there are 3 parts to a loop. 
i=0
while i # insert missing code.
    print('insert missing value')
    # insert missing code here
    i=0
while 1 < 10:
  print[i]
  i+=1 
# 2. Create a simple while loop that will iterate over a the following condition:
# The loop will ask the user to enter the secret number. The secret number is 3. 
# If the user enters the secret number correctly, the loop will stop and tell the user
# the can win a prize. 
# If the user puts in an incorrect secret number, the loop will ask them to enter the 
# correct secret number. 

if the sercet_number = 3
print {3< prize}
 else the sercet number isnt 3
 print{2< no prize}

# 3. describe the difference between a while loop and a conditional statement. 
# Try be as specific as you can

a while loop is a om going loop that will going over and over 
condition  statement is a statement that will run or push one time 

# 4. Create a while loop that will iterate over the list of names 
# and print out only the following name: William

names= ['Avery','Paige','William','Ade','Jasmyn','Crystal']

list of names{'avery,paige,william,ade,jasmyn,Crystal}

index=1
names ={avert,paige,william,ade,jasmyn,Crystal}
for 1 in names 
print{index}
index += 1
#output
1.'Avery',
2.'Paige','
3.William','
4.Ade','
5.Jasmyn','
6.Crystal'
# 5. Create a loop that will ask the user to add a new string value to the list of names above.
# hint you will need use append().
list_of_names'{Avery','Paige','William','Ade','Jasmyn','Crystal}
input{string["eneter name"]
print{string}{new name}
