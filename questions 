My experience at cesium was good and interesting i learned bout software and VR however my questions was not answered by i did learn Like how VR can be use for like modeling on what you want to built or plan out and can use drones to scan the area to plan what they going to do next. Also i learned when it comes to software is tranfaring  data and using data to give information  and using  AI to transfer data and learn from it.To do programming you got to be good beause anyone can be go at coding but you got to make something to make it a good prgram.When it comes to software like about the world you need data  scan the world and every country  to gather that data for the program.I learned about WebGL and that was a based engine that bring 3D geospatial to the web and over 2 million codes.engine unreal and unitly both of them use to built or create games but unity is use for moble and VR games and base start as a engine.
