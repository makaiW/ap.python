# 1. Explain what built-in functions are? Then describe and proivde 
# code examples of three (3) built-in functions we learned about in class. 
 ones for which the compiler generates inline code at compile time.
 str{}
 len{}
 float{}

# 2. provide three (3) code examples of how to use a conditional statement. you will need to use one (1) of each of the following
# operators in your examples: assignment operator, the logical operator and comparison operator.
a example of assigment is the equal sign  =
a example of logical is <>
a example of compariason equal to,not equal to,greater then,less then 
# 3.Create function that will loop through the list of numbers provide below and multiply each number by 3

# 4. Create a function that will check is a user's input is a palendrome.
# HINT1: a palendrome is a word that reads the same way backwards as it does forwards
# HINT 2: you will need to use a loop.
