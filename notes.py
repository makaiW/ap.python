#pyhon loops:A funcation is a block of instruction that will only execute when called
a python for while loop is a piece of code that iterates or loops overa statement as long as the conditionis true
meaning so long as the staement your write in your code is true that block of code or code instruction will contine to run 
a loop repeats  itself 

#The iterator-This is a variable that acts as the starting point  for our loops 
The condition- this will be the what we are evaluating.Depending on what we set our condition to it will continuce to loops
until condition is met 
The incrementor- This will be the counter,or the number of times yours loop will run.We use the +=assigment operator

#Bonus the beaker-This keyord is used when we want to create a
