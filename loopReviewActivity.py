 #Create a security camera program that uses a while loop to detect if there is an
# object in site. 

# Create a Printer Loop program that will continue to print copies of a document based on the number
# that the user inputs. 

# Create a Stop Light Loop that will change the light color based on different time intervals. 
# every 30 seconds the light should change between green and red. 

# BONUS: add an additional condition that will change the light to yellow for 5 seconds before the
# next light change.
