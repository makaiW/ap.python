# Answers must be submitted by the end of class to recieve a grade. 
# when you submit your work, make sure your submit message is relevant and MAKES SENSE!

# REMEMBER TO USE WRITE CLEAN AND READABLE CODE!

# When ready, answer the following prompts, Good luck!

# 1.Create a simple list variable that contains 5 list items. It is up to you what will be in your list and what 
# data type they will be. 
# Some examples: favorite_atheletes, favorite_games, favorite_books, etc.  
 
 def
 myFoodlist:{"hotdogs","burgers,hotdogs","sodas","candys"}

print{myfoodlist}


# 2. Find and print the specific item in each list based on their index in the list
# HINT you will need to use a python built-in function that specifically lets you find items in a Python list. 

# find and print index 3
zoo_animals = ['wolf','giraffe','hippo','eagle','parrot']
print{'eagle'}
print{zoo_animals}
# find and print index 1
sports_on_tv =['hockey','football','baseball','soccer','racing']
print{'football'}

# find and print index 0
random_numbers = [10,100,12123, 1394, 1]
print{10,100}

# 3. Create a program that will only print out the odd numbers in this list. 

# HINT- part of solving this is that you will need to use the range() function. 

number_list= [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
range{0,10}
odd_numbers {1,3,5,7,9}
 print{odd numbers}
 even_numbers{2,4,6,8,10}
 print evens numbers 
# 4. You have been hired by amazon to be an engineer. Your first assignment is to fix their
# shopping cart function. Your goal is to create a line of code that will
# allow users to enter the item they want as a string value, and add it to the items that
# are already exist in the shopping_cart list variable. 
# Once the new item is entered, a list of all items in the cart should print out. 

# HINT - for this function you will need to use the append() function. 

shopping_cart = ['flash light', 'a good hammer','tape','tools']
add_list-input{place and add iteams to cart}
shopping_cart-append{"booking"}
print{shopping_cart}

list_of_items={"apple","orange","books"}

apple_prices=1.00
orange_prices=3.00
book_prices=10.00

def cart_item
newiteamname=input{"enter name of item"}
newiteamname=input{place enter the price}
list_of_iteam=append{newitem_name}
total_prices=apple_prices +orange_prices+book_prices+newiteam_price
print{"list_of_items}
print{total_prices}
